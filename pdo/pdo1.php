//PDO in PHP
//PDO stands for PHP Data Objects. PDO is a PHP extension that provides an interface for accessing databases in PHP. PDO is a general database abstraction layer with support for MySQL among many other databases. PDO is not an abstraction layer like PearDB. PDO is a more like a data access layer which uses a unified API (Application Programming Interface).
//PDO provides a uniform interface across different databases. PDO provides a data-access abstraction layer, which means that, regardless of which database you're using, you use the same functions to issue queries and fetch data. PDO does not provide a database abstraction; it doesn't rewrite SQL or emulate missing features. You should use a full-blown abstraction layer if you need that facility.
//PDO is not an O/R mapping tool like Doctrine. PDO is a low-level abstraction layer. PDO does not offer many of the features of Doctrine or Propel. PDO does not offer object-relational mapping, complex query building, or other advanced features. PDO is a simple database abstraction layer with a limited feature set.
//PDO is not a database design tool like phpMyAdmin. PDO is not a database management tool. PDO is not a database design tool. PDO is not a database administration tool. PDO is a database access layer for PHP applications.
